Passkeys one button

In this page, you can experience authentication through a dedicated **Sign-in
with a passkey** button. We call it "passkey one button" flow. In addition, you
can try WebAuthn Signal API.

## How to use

Tap on **Sign in with a passkey** button. If you have a passkey, it displays the
passkey dialog. Otherwise, you will be redirected to a password-based sign-in
form if "immediate mediation" is supported. If "immediate mediation" is not
supported, a QR code dialog is displayed so you can scan it and sign in using a
passkey stored to that device.

If your sign-in attempt is rejected by the server because the public key is not
found on the server, the password manager will delete the passkey to avoid
further confusion. This is done by WebAuthn Signal API.

## How to develop

Use [WebAuthn](https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn/) to build a passkey one button
experience by invoking `navigator.credentials.get()` with a public key option.

There are a lot of tricks you can perform to make the passkey authentication
experience better. Here's a checklist:

* Signal when a passkey's matching credential is not found on the backend with
[`PublicKeyCredential.signalUnknownCredential()`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/identity/webauthn-signal-api#signal-that-a-credential-does-not-exist).  
* Prompt users to manually create a passkey if the user hasn't created one after
a sign-in.  
* [Automatically create a passkey (conditional
create)](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/identity/webauthn-conditional-create)
after the user signs in with a password (and a second factor).  
* Prompt for local passkey creation [if the user has signed in with a
cross-device
passkey](https://web.dev/articles/passkey-form-autofill#encourage_creating_a_new_passkey_after_a_cross-device_authentication).  
* [Signal the list of available
passkeys](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/identity/webauthn-signal-api#signal-a-list-of-saved-credentials)
and [updated user details (username, display
name)](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/identity/webauthn-signal-api#signal-updated-username-and-display-name)
to the provider after sign-in
