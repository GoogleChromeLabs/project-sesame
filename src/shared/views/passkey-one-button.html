In this page, you can experience authentication through a dedicated **Sign-in
with a passkey** button. We call it "passkey one button" flow. In addition, you
can try WebAuthn Signal API.

## How to use

Tap on **Sign in with a passkey** button. If you have a passkey, it displays the
passkey dialog. Otherwise, you will be redirected to a password-based sign-in
form if "immediate mediation" is supported. If "immediate mediation" is not
supported, a QR code dialog is displayed so you can scan it and sign in using a
passkey stored to that device.

If your sign-in attempt is rejected by the server because the public key is not
found on the server, the password manager will delete the passkey to avoid
further confusion. This is done by WebAuthn Signal API.

## How to develop

### Immediate mediation

Still in development. Use `mediation: 'immediate'`.

### WebAuthn Signal API

If your sign-in attempt with a passkey fails on the server after a successful
user verification, it's most likely due to the signature not verified on the
server, because the public key is not found. In such a circumstance, keeping the
passkey in the passkey provider is nothing but confusing.

By using Signal API, the RP can let the passkey provider know a specific passkey
is not known to the RP, so that it can delete the matching passkey from the
passkey provider, if it supports the feature.

API](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/identity/webauthn-signal-api)
