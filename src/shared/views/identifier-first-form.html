## How to use

Use a passkey or a password through form autofill to sign in, or enter a
username to continue.

If you haven't created a passkey on this website yet, you can enter an
arbitrary username and continue. No account creation is required.

At the next page, enter a random password and you will be signed in.
Also, your account will be created.

Once you are signed in, create a new passkey and sign out to come back
here to try the passkey.

### Sign in with a passkey

To sign in with a passkey, place your cursor on the username field.
You'll notice the autofill dialog contains your passkeys as well as
passwords. Select the passkey you want to sign in with, and perform
[user verification](https://web.dev/articles/webauthn-user-verification)
when prompted. Then you'll be signed in.

## How to develop

### Passkey form autofill

You can learn how to build passkeys form autofill experience at [Sign in
with a passkey through form
autofill](https://web.dev/articles/passkey-form-autofill) and
[Server-side passkey
authentication](https://developers.google.com/identity/passkeys/developer-guides/server-authentication).

You can also learn through a codelab: [Implement passkeys with form autofill in a web app](https://goo.gle/passkeys-codelab)

### Signal API

If your sign-in attempt with a passkey fails on the server after a
successful user verification, it's most likely due to the signature not
being verified on the server, because the public key is not found. In
such a circumstance, keeping the passkey in the passkey provider is
nothing but confusing.

By using Signal API, the RP can let the passkey provider know a specific
passkey is not known to the RP, so that it can delete the matching
passkey from the passkey provider, if it supports the feature.
