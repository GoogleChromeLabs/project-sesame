Passkey form autofill

In this page, you can experience authentication through a form that can
accommodate passkeys and passwords. We call it "passkey form autofill" flow. In
addition, WebAuthn Signal API deletes a passkey when it's unusable.

## How to use

Put your cursor on the username field and form autofill suggestions should
appear. The list contains passkeys and passwords that are stored to the password
manager, so you can select one to proceed signing in.

If you haven't created a passkey on this website yet, you can enter an arbitrary
username and continue. You can enter a random password in the next page to
create an account. The password will be ignored.

If you do have entries in the password manager:

  * Select a password entry, and associated username will be filled in the
  username field, so that you can **Continue** to enter a password.
  * Select a passkey entry, and a passkey dialog will appear to proceed with
  user verification, and you'll be signed in.

If your sign-in attempt is rejected by the server because the public key is not
found on the server, the password manager will delete the passkey to avoid
further confusion. This is done by WebAuthn Signal API.

## How to develop

### Passkey form autofill

You can enable passkey form autofill by appending `mediation: "conditional"` to
the `navigator.credentials.get()` call to an ordinary passkey authentication
invocation. Also, the `input` element must contain `webauthn` within its
`autocomplete` attribute.

You can learn passkey basic development through:

* [Sign in with a passkey through form
autofill](https://web.dev/articles/passkey-form-autofill)
* [Server-side passkey
authentication](https://developers.google.com/identity/passkeys/developer-guides/server-authentication)
* [Implement passkeys with form autofill in a web app](https://goo.gle/passkeys-codelab)

### WebAuthn Signal API

If your sign-in attempt with a passkey fails on the server after a successful
user verification, it's most likely due to the signature not verified on the
server, because the public key is not found. In such a circumstance, keeping the
passkey in the passkey provider is nothing but confusing.

By using Signal API, the RP can let the passkey provider know a specific passkey
is not known to the RP, so that it can delete the matching passkey from the
passkey provider, if it supports the feature.
