Always add comments to your code following these guidelines:
- **Purpose**: Describe what the code is doing and, more importantly, **why** it is doing it.
- **Style**: Use JSDoc style for all functions, classes, and interfaces.
- **Inline Comments**: Use inline comments to explain complex logic or non-obvious implementation details.
